The official website for SDRF-Proteomics project is https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-sample-metadata. New use cases, changes to the specification and examples can be added by using Pull requests or issues in GitHub (see introduction to GitHub - https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

A set of examples and annotated projects from ProteomeXchange can be found here: https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-sample-metadata/tree/master/annotated-projects

Multiple tools have been implemented to validate SDRF-Proteomics files:

- sdrf-pipelines (Python - https://github.com/bigbio/sdrf-pipelines): This tool allows a user to validate an SDRF-Proteomics file. In addition, it allows a user to convert SDRF to other popular pipelines and software configuration files such as: MaxQuant or OpenMS.

- jsdrf (Java - https://github.com/bigbio/jsdrf ): This Java library and tool allows a user to validate SDRF-Proteomics files. It also includes a generic data model that can be used by Java applications.
